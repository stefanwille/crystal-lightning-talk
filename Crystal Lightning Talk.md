# Crystal


## Introduction

I find people are looking for a language to complement Ruby for performance, concurrency. I started to look around too. I found Crystal.


## What is Crystal?

* Crystal is a new programming language
* Statically typed, compiled (other than Ruby!) => better performance


## Why talk about it here at RailsGirls?

Demo: Fibonacci: Ruby
Demo: Fibonacci: Crystal
==> Syntax so Ã¤hnlich wie bei Ruby

How possible? Global type inference



Examples: Fibonacci mit und ohne Typen


## Why invent Crystal?

Manastech is...

Their goals (abbreviated):
* Ruby-inspired syntax.
* Never have to specify the type of a variable or method argument.
* Compile to efficient native code.


## Why use Crystal?

* Performance -  because statically typed, Compiler
* Familiar syntax, familiar standard library (Array, String, Enumerable...)
* Less lines of code compared to other statically typed languages
* Concurrency, better IO - e.g. websockets - (like Go)
* Statically linked binaries


## Good for?

* Command line tools (like ack)
* Background workers
* APIs (such as for mobile, or client side MVC frameworks)
* Websockets



## Statically linked binaries

## Concurrency Features wie Go

Beispiel: spawn / channel


## Performance: Sieve

Ruby vs. Crystal


## Performance: Web


## Performance: Crystal-Redis

* What is Redis?
* What is Crystal-Redis?
* Benchmark work: Chart


## Status?

* pre 1.0
* Manastech uses it for clients in production
* Others probably do not for critical work
* Now is a good time to get involved


## Crystal vs Ruby

* The more I try other programming languages, the more I appreciate Ruby!
* Performance
